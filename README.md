# WAV-Music-Player-With-Python
My first solo project. A basic WAV music player made with Python. Originally I was looking to use MP3 files but Python has issues with them.
I did have trouble with adding directory paths to allow it to work for all users, so at line 24, 46, 77, 100, 124, 165, 166, 167 and 168 you'll have to add
your own file paths.
